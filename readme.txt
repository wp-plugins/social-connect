Allow your visitors to comment, login and register with their Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo or WordPress.com account.

== Description ==

Social Connect adds social login buttons on the login, register and comment forms of your WordPress site.

The buttons offer login and registration using a Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo or WordPress.com account.

It makes it super easy for new members to register with your site and existing members to login.

Special thanks to:

* [Wirone](http://blog.wirone.info/) for polish translation and patches; and
* [markusdrake](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/markusdrake) for patches and helping in the support forums.

== Installation ==

1. Upload everything into the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory of your WordPress site.
2. Activate in the "Plugins" admin panel.
3. Visit the "Settings | Social Connect" administration page to configure. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Social Connect work with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes.

= Does Social Connect work with the Theme My Login plugin? =

Yes.

= Do I need to add template tags to my theme? =

No social connect works with the default WordPress login and registration forms. 

If you want to add the social connect login or registration forms to another location in your theme, you can insert the following code in that location:

`<?php if( 'sc_render_login_form_social_connect' ) sc_render_login_form_social_connect(); ?>`

= Where can I get support? =

First, a few caveats on support. 

This is free software. Please be patient. All questions *will* be answered, just not on the same day. Polite and descriptive questions will always be given priority.

Please search the support forums before asking a question - duplicate questions will not receive a reply.

With those caveats in mind, ask questions in the [Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/social-connect?forum_id=10#postform).

To help me diagnose the issue, please include the following information in your post on the [Forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/social-connect?forum_id=10#postform):

* what specifically is broken in Social Connect (eg. the buttons don't show up or it doesn't redirect back form Google)
* what you did just before Social Connect stopped working (eg. activated, enabled all OpenID providers, clicked the Google login button)
* version of the plugin
* version of WordPress
* list of other plugins installed
* error messages you receive (if any)

= Why doesn't Social Connect Work? =

Please make sure you are running the latest version of Social Connect and the latest version of WordPress. 

If you have White Label CMS installed, the javascript it adds to your login page breaks all other plugins which run javascript on the login form. 

For a quick fix and for more information see here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/social-connect-does-not-work-at-all?replies=7#post-2029255

If you don't have White Label CMS installed, please double check your settings then post a question in the [Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/social-connect?forum_id=10#postform). 

== Screenshots ==

1. **Login** - on the login and registration form, buttons for 3rd party services are provided.
2. **Comment** - buttons for 3rd party services are also provided on the comment form.
